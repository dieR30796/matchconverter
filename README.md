# Simple String Converter for Match Information.
This project is a simple string converter. It takes in a raw .data file which can be specified by the user and then outputs a formatted version of the inputted strings.


## Getting Started
To get this up and running you will need:
```
Java 9+
```
Once you clone the repository you need to:
```
cd into the project folder /matchconverter where you have cloned it too.
run java -jar converter.jar.
in the command prompt type in input.data
```
I have included the jar in the project to make it easier however if you would like to see the tests or do the build yourself you can:
```
mvn clean install (this will rebuild the jar and run the tests)
mvn test (will run the tests)
```
